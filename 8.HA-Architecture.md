# HA ARCHITECTURE

- **Availability:** can be described as the % of a time period when the service will be able to respond to your request in some fashion.
- **Durability:** refers to the on-going existence of the object or resource.
- **Resiliency:** can be described as the ability to a system to self heal after damage or an event.
- **Reliability:** is the probability that a system will work as designed. This term is not used much in AWS, but is still worth understanding.


## Elastic Load Balancers

It is a phisical or virtual device to load balance the network.

Protocols:
  - Layer 7 (Application Layer): HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, SSH, POP3, SMTP, IMAP, SNMP, DNS, PING
  - Layer 4 (Transport Layer): TCP, UDP, RTP..
  - Layer 3 (Network Layer): IPv4, IPv6

### Types:

  - **Application Load Balancer:** 
    - HTTP/HTTPS traffic.
    - Operation at Application Layer (Layer 7).
    - Intelligent Routing. Example, send requests to web server per country.
  - **Network Load Balancer:** 
    - TCP traffic. 
    - Operation at the connection level (Layer 4).
    - Extreme performance.
  - **Classic Load Balancer:** 
    - Legacy Elastic Load Balancers.
    - HTTP/HTTPS trafic. Layer 7-specific features: X-Forwarded and sticky sessions.
    - TCP traffic. Layer 4.
    - Keep you costs down
    - Don't need Intelligent Routing.

### Features


### Health Check
 
Configuration:

Instances monitored by ELB are reported as InService / OutofService 
 
### Stick Session

Stick Session enable your users to stick to the same EC2 instance. Can be usefull if you are storeing information locally to that instance.

  - Can configure for Classic Load Balance.
  - Can configure Stick Session for Application Load Balance, but traffic will be sent at the Target Group Level.
  
### Cross Zone Load Balancing

Cross Zone Load Balance enables you to load balance across zone.



  - Configure Route 53 to send 50/50 percent traffic to zone, and then use Load Balance.


  - Common Exam Scenario
    - Route 53 send 100% traffic to Zone A, Load Balance configure to traffic to Zone A EC2. Configure Cross Zone to traffic requests to Zone B EC2.


### Path Patterns

Path Patterns allow you to direct traffic to different EC2 instance based on the URL contained in the request.

  - Can configure for Application Load Balance.
  - Microservices

  - Common Exam Scenario
    - Route 53 send 100% traffic to Zone A, Load balance configure to traffic to Zone A EC2 with path pattern (mysite.com). Configure path pattern to send traffic from mysite.com/images/ to Zone B EC2.



## TIPS
 - application load balancer: intelligent routing
 - network load balancer: performance
 - classic load balancer: 
 - instances monitored by ELB are reported as InService / OutofService
 - Helf checks check the instance heath by taking to it.
 - Load Balancers have their own DNS name. you are never given an IP address.
 - Read FAQ for Classic Load Balancers (~10 questions in exam)



### TIPs:

  - Stick Session enable your users to stick to the same EC2 instance. Can be usefull if you are storeing information locally to that instance.
  - Cross Zone Load Balance enables you to load balance across zone.
  - Path patterns allow you to direct traffic to different EC2 instance based on the URL contained in the request.





	
	- 504 error (gateway timeout): application not responding within the idle timeout period (Web server layer or Database Layer).
  	- If you need the IPv4 adderes of your end user, looock for the X-Forwarded-For header.




## AUTO SCALING

three to four question in exams

  - three components:
    - Groups: Logical component. Webserver, application or database group, etc.
    - Configuration Templates: groups use a launch template or a launch configuration. AMI ID, instance types, securit groups...
    - Scalling Options: rules to scale groups. 
    	- maintain current instance levels at all times
    	  - example, 10 EC2 when one unhealth, the scaling to 10 EC2 up
    	- scale manually
    	  - configure number of resource, when change configuration, auto scalling create or terminate instance.
    	- scale based on a schedule
    	  - scale by schedule using a function of datetime. Example, scale up 10 EC2 on 6:00 AM, and scale down 2 EC2 instance on 10:00 PM. 
    	- scale based on demand
    	  - scale using polices. Parameters to control the scaling process. Example, scale up a new EC2 instance when 50% CPU utilization.
    	  - most popular.
    	- use predictive scaling
    	  - NEW option
    	  - combination with EC2 Auto Scaling and Auto Scaling.
    	  - predictive and dynamic scaling (proactive and reactive aprroaches)

    	- Can configure Classic Load Balance
    	- Multiple Zone
    	- Delete Auto Scale Groups, delete de EC2 instances.


    	- launch configurations: configure launch configurations: AMI ID, bootstrap script, IP address type, security groups, etc..
    	- auto scaling groups: group size (number of instances), load balancing, heath checks. Scaling between 3 of 6 instances, average CPU utilization, target value (80% cpu), 60 seconds to scaling.

    - healthy checks can be load balance or EC2


# HA ARCHITECTURE

  - Netflix Simian Army project, inject failure into the production systems.

  - TIPS:
    - Always design for failure.
    - Use Multiple AZ's and Multiple Regions where ever you can
    - Know the difference between Multi-AZ and Read Replicas for RDS
    - Know the difference between scaling out and scaling up
    - Read the question carefully and always consider the cost element.
    - Know the different S3 storage classes



## CLOUD FORMATION

[ADICIONAR UMA EXPLICAÇÃO SOBRE]


  - template json

  - template types:
    - Sample template
    - upload template to S3
    - specify an amazon S3 template URL


  - TIPS:
    - is a way of completely scriptiong your cloud environment
    - Quick Start = crate complex enviromnents very quickly


## ELASTIC BEANSTALK

[ADICIONAR UMA EXPLICAÇÃO SOBRE]

  - Quickly deploy and manage applications. You simply upload your application, and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the etais of capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling and application health monitoring.
  - it will grow out your infrastucture



## summary

  - Load balancer
    - Application Load Balancers: more inteligent
    - Network load balancer: extreme performance
    - Classic load balance: dont intelligent rooting, keep your costs down
    - 504 error gateway has timed out 
    - troubleshoot the application or database layer
    - if you need the IPv4 adress of your end user, look for the X-Forwarded-For header
    - Instance monitored by ELB are reported as InServer or OutofService
	- Health checks check the instance health by talking to it
	- Load balancers have their own DNS name. You are never given an IP address
	- Read he ELB FAQ for Classic Load Balancers
	- ~10 questions
	
  - Stick Sessions enable your users to stick to the same EC2 instance.
  - Cross Zone Load Balancing, multiple availability zone.
  - Path Patterns: redirect traffic to different EC2 instance based on the URL contained in the request

  - Cloud Formation is a way more powerfull than Elastic Beanstalk
